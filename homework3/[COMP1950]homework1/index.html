<h2>My Travel Bucket List</h2> 
    <p>
        I've been lucky enough to have traveled quite a bit up until this point in my life. One trip still on my bucket list is the South West Coast Path in England. This path is 630miles long, so typically travelers pick a section to complete. The path itself runs along the cliffs and passes cities such as Cornwall, Port Isaac, and Bigbury-on-Sea. I've included some images below of the path and it's views.
